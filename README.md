# 21st.dev
[21st.dev](https://21st.dev) is an open source community registry of React UI components where anyone can publish minimal Tailwind & Radix UI components and install any component via `npx shadcn`.

Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Built by RorkAI team and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

## Publish your component
It takes 1 min to publish via our [publish page](https://21st.dev). To punblish, you just need two files: `component.tsx` and `component.demo.tsx`.

We support:
- Pure React components 
- Next.js client components (currently, we polyfill Next-specific libraries in CodeSandbox, but will switch to server-side rendering)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind themes
- RadixUI
- Any other npm dependencies (via [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/))
- Internal dependencies (you use any component of our registry as a dependency)

We encourage everyone to post TypeScript components, JS support is currently untested.

## Install a component
Pick a component from [21st.dev](https://21st.dev), copy the `npx shadcn` command, and run in your project's root folder.

For instance, for `shadcn/ui/accordion` you'll run:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/shadcn/accordion"
```

The command will create all the necessary files for the component and its dependencies (excluding the `.demo.tsx` file), and extend your Tailwind theme.

You can also copy the code directly from the website, but note that youâ€™ll need to copy and paste all the files for the component and its dependencies, so using the `npx shadcn` command is the recommended way.

## Contributing to 21st

1. Fork the GitHub repo, clone to your local editor (we recommend Cursor if you're non-technical)

2. Install dependencies (we love `pnpm`)

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the development server for all apps and packages in the monorepo.

    This project uses Vercel turborepo. For more information on working with Turborepo, refer to the [Turborepo documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

4. Open a PR to `main` branch
